//Exercise 5

float tal2 = 3;
int tal1 = 2;
int tal3 = tal1 + tal2;
println(tal3);

/*
The above code gives the error "cannot convert from float to int"
Which means it cannot convert the type float to int.
It is beacuse we have two numbers defined one of the type int and the other float.
And int the definition of tal3 we add tal1 to tal2, and say the result must be and int.
So we get an error beacue you cannot convert a decimal variable to a interger variable.
If we where to define tal3 as a float it would work as you can add whole number to a float but not add floats to a whole number.
